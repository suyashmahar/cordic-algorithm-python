# CORDIC Algorithms in python
This repository contains python implementation of CORDIC algorithms in Jupyter notebook. All the description is within the only jupyter notebook. 

All the implementation is within a single jupyter notebook. Implementation is almost similar to what is mentioned in Ray Andraka's paper *A survey of CORDIC algorithms for FPGA based computers (1988).* With few changes which are described in the notes at the end of the implementation.

Link for [jupyter notebook](cordic_implementation.ipynb)

All the description of the algorithm is within the Jupyter notebook due to no support of LaTeX in markdown.
